# Pandas Tutorial

Pandas is data analysis tool for python. Pandas operates on Dataframes, which
are 2D tables that can be imported and exported to various formats such as 
CSV, Excel spreadsheets, SQL or high performant file formats such as HDF5. 

This tutorial is aimed at people who have prior experience with programming,
not necessarily python. This tutorial will walk through basic of python 
programming before the introduction of Pandas.

use Anaconda distribution of python which can be [downloaded here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
Please download python 2.7 for your OS. After installing, find the Spyder
editor shipped with Anaconda.
